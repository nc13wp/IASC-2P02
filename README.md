## Bio

I am a third year Interactive Arts and Science student primarily focused on Media Archeology and the ways this topic can be represented, both through graphics and text. I am fascinated by analysis of media artifacts of the past and how they have impacted the media of the present. My featured project is an example of my media archeological work, exploring the history of wearable technologies through the Xybernaut wearable computers of the early 2000s. As media archeology is a broad, interpretive field, the ways in which this research is represented should reflect that, while still being clear and legible. This is the topic I tackle in my academic blog post, which deals with the form of interpretive graphical displays within the digital humanities. This is a response to an article by Johanna Drucker, who argues that graphics should be heavily interpretive â€“ where as I argue for a compromise between clarity and subjectivity. My collaborative project explores PRISM, a tool for collaborative interpretation of text. The PRISM tool is useful for group interpretation of the types of content created for the technologies that I discuss in my work as a media archeologist, which can reveal much about the technology's function and impact. As media evolves, the need for media archeologists grows. In the future, I plan to cast an archeological lens on video game consoles and home PCs.
